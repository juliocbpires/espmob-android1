    <string name="description">Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard Stark, tours in war-torn Afghanistan with his best friend and military liaison, James Rhodes, to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings and Stark is gravely wounded by a missile used by the attackersâ€”one of his company\'s own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark\'s chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word.</string>
